  <h2>Automatic Essay Feedback Tool</h2>
  <p>My degree involved writing lots of essays. I was frustrated at how slow the teachers were in giving us feedback. So I built an automatic feedback tool. It lacks the deep capacities of a human being, but - with some more work - automated essay feedback could really help students in future years. GitHub does not support PHP - view the automaticEssayFeedback tool in action:<br>

  <h2>The Real Uni Guide</h2>
  <p>When students go to uni, they are scared. I wanted to make them less scared, so I built a website with guides for 25 UK universities.</p><br>
